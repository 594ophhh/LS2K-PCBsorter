# LS2K-PCBsorter
An intelligent robotic sorting system utilizing Loongson's 2K1000LA processor for automated PCB quality inspection and classification. Implements computer vision algorithms for defect detection and QR code recognition, coupled with a 6-DOF robotic arm for precise handling.

This repository contains the complete source code for a PCB sorting system prototype developed on the Loongson 2K1000LA processor platform, demonstrating industrial automation capabilities through Python-based implementation. The system integrates four core components: robotic arm control logic in 7_8robotic_arm, PyQt5 graphical interface in PCB_client_v19, display management in app, and precision motor control in motor. All vision processing including PCB defect detection and QR code recognition is implemented in Python using OpenCV, while wireless communication relies exclusively on the Fibocom L610 LTE module configured through standard AT commands.
The development environment requires Python 3.7 on a Loongson 2K1000LA board running Loongnix or compatible Linux distribution. The LTE module needs proper USB connection and carrier-specific APN configuration before use. This research prototype has been fully validated in laboratory conditions, verifying the technical feasibility of using Loongson processors for industrial automation applications.
As experimental work rather than production-grade equipment, the project welcomes improvements through standard GitHub workflows, with particular interest in enhancements to vision algorithms and LTE communication reliability. Always verify hardware safety protocols before operating mechanical components. The code is released under [Your License Here] as an open demonstration of domestic industrial automation technology.
